   abstract = {The detection of acoustic signals is of relevance for a range of practical applications, for example in medical diagnostics. However, whereas rectification of electric current and other energy forms such as thermal flux has been demonstrated, acoustic rectification has not yet been achieved. Here, on the basis of the earlier theoretical proposal of an 'acoustic diode', we present the first experimental demonstration of a rectified energy flux of acoustic waves. A one-dimensional acoustic rectifier is fabricated by coupling a superlattice with a layer of ultrasound contrast agent microbubble suspension. A significant rectifying effect is observed within two frequency bands at locations that agree well with theoretical predictions. Following optimization of the concentration of the microbubble suspension, rectifying ratios can be as high as ~10(4). This realization of an acoustic rectifier should have substantial practical significance, for example in the focusing of ultrasound in medical applications.},

   abstract = {We report experimental manipulation of the magnetic states of elliptical cobalt magnetostrictive nanomagnets (with nominal dimensions of approximately 340 nm x 270 nm x 12 nm) delineated on bulk 128 degrees Y-cut lithium niobate with acoustic waves (AWs) launched from interdigitated electrodes. Isolated nanomagnets (no dipole interaction with any other nanomagnet) that are initially magnetized with a magnetic field to a single-domain state with the magnetization aligned along the major axis of the ellipse are driven into a vortex state by acoustic waves that modulate the stress anisotropy of these nanomagnets. The nanomagnets remain in the vortex state until they are reset by a strong magnetic field to the initial single-domain state, making the vortex state nonvolatile. This phenomenon is modeled and explained using a micromagnetic framework and could lead to the development of extremely energy efficient magnetization switching methodologies for low-power computing applications.},

   abstract = {Directional transport and propagation of quantum particle and current, such as electron, photon, spin, and phonon, are known to occur in the materials system with broken inversion symmetry, as exemplified by the diode in semiconductor p-n junction and the natural optical activity in chiral materials. Such a nonreciprocal response in the quantum materials of noncentrosymmetry occurs ubiquitously when the time-reversal symmetry is further broken by applying a magnetic field or with spontaneous magnetization, such as the magnetochiral effect and the nonreciprocal magnon transport or spin current in chiral magnets. In the nonlinear regime responding to the square of current and electric field, even a more variety of nonreciprocal phenomena can show up, including the photocurrent of topological origin and the unidirectional magnetoresistance in polar/chiral semiconductors. Microscopically, these nonreciprocal responses in the quantum materials are frequently encoded by the quantum Berry phase, the toroidal moment, and the magnetoelectric monopole, thus cultivating the fertile ground of the functional topological materials. Here, we review the basic mechanisms and emergent phenomena and functions of the nonreciprocal responses in the noncentrosymmetric quantum materials.},
